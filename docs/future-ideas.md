# Future Ideas

Ideas for potential future RoomVox features. These are not planned or committed — just captured for consideration.

## Room photo

Allow administrators to upload a photo of a room. This gives bookers a visual impression of the space before booking — size, layout, available equipment, and overall atmosphere. Photos are shown in the room browser and room detail view.

## Lunch ordering

Integrate lunch or catering ordering into the booking flow. When booking a room, the organizer can optionally add a lunch or catering order for the meeting. This could connect to an external catering system or provide a simple order form with predefined options.

## Room layout selection

Allow rooms to have multiple layout configurations (e.g., theatre, boardroom, U-shape, classroom). When booking, the organizer can select the desired layout. Room managers or facility staff receive the layout preference so the room can be prepared accordingly.
